# 14 MLIR - The basis of Mojo

*Direct access to MLIR*
Mojo provides full access to the MLIR dialects and ecosystem. Please take a look at the Low level IR in Mojo notebook how to use the __mlir_type, __mlir_op, and __mlir_type constructs. All of the built-in and standard library APIs are implemented by just calling the underlying MLIR constructs, and in doing so, Mojo effectively serves as syntax sugar on top of MLIR.

See `use_module.mojo`:

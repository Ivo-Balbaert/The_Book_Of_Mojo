# 3 Basic building blocks
We'll start by discussing the last code snippet of Â§ 2.

## 3.1 The main function, def and fn, variables and types
Mojo is a compiled language, and thus when code is stored in `.mojo` files, a `main()` function is required as the entry point to a program. 

See `first.mojo`:
```py
fn main():
    var n: Int = 1      # 1
    n += 1              # 2
    print(n)            # => 2
```

>Note: The main() function isnâ€™t required in a REPL or notebook environment, where code is JIT-compiled. That's why in the notebook code, we had to call it explicitly.

Like in Python, `main()` has no parameters and no return value.

>Note: Why didn't we write the Python form `def main()`, instead of `fn main()`? It turns out that both forms of function can be used in Mojo, but they have different meaning. `def` functions are dynamic, flexible and types are optional, which makes it easier to port Python functions to Mojo. `fn` is meant for stricter code: it enforces strongly-typed and memory-safe behavior. Supporting both `def` and `fn` makes it easier to port Python functions to Mojo.

From line 1, we see that Mojo also uses indentation to define code blocks, instead of the { } found in C-type languages. Mojo also knows `print`, as well as control-flow syntax such as `if` conditions and `for` loops.

We also declare a variable `n` with the keyword `var`, which means it is a real mutable variable whose value can change. If you need to define an immutable variable (a constant), use `let` instead.

>Note: Take care to only use var when really needed!

What happens when you change var to let? You get a compiler error:  
```
error: Expression [15]:7:5: expression must be mutable for in-place operator destination
    n += 1
    ^
```
Indeed in line 2, the value of n is incremented. The line is equivalent to: `n = n + 1`. `let` makes n immutable.

If var is omitted, you get another error:
```
??
```

Unlike in def functions, in fn functions you need to use either var or let when a local variable is declared.

Also in line 1, we see that the type of n is declared as `Int`, an integer. *Declaring the type is not required for local variables in fn*, but it can be useful and increases performance.
Mojo has so-called *progressive typing*: adding more types leads to better performance and error checking, the code becomes safer and more reliable.
If the type is omitted, it is inferred by the compiler, that is: derived from the type of value the variable is initialized with (here the integer 1).

Here is an example snippet which uses `let` for declarations (see `let.mojo`):
```py
fn main()
    do_math()

fn do_math():
    let x: Int = 1
    let y = 2        # 1
    print(x + y)     # => 3
```

In line 2, the type of variable `y` is also inferred to be Int.
(?? What happens when you leave out fn main())

What happens when?
?? Int is omitted

Finally, we see a convention here:  
* variable and function names start with a lowercase letter
* types (like `Int`) start with an uppercase letter, and follow PascalCase style.

## 3.2 Function arguments and return type
Functions declared as `fn` in Mojo must specify the types of their arguments. If a value is returned, its type must be specified after a `->` and before the body of the function.

This is illustrated in the `sum` function in the following example (see line 1):  
See `sum.mojo`:
```py
fn main():
    z = sum(1, 2)
    print(z)    # => 3

fn sum(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int:  # 1
    return x + y
```

By default, a function cannot modify its arguments values. They are immutable references and read-only. 

?? Try out: let sum change x

Arguments are only *borrowed* by convention. You can make this explicit by writing:  

```py
fn sum(borrowed x: Int, borrowed y: Int) -> Int:  
    return x + y
```

## 3.3 Can a function change its arguments?
## 3.3.1 inout 
For a function's the arguments to be mutable, you need to declare them as *inout*. This means that changes made to the arguments inside the function are visible outside the function.  
This is illustrated in the following example (see `inout.mojo`):  

```py
fn main():
    var a = 1
    var b = 2
    c = sum_inout(a, b)
    print(a)  # => 2
    print(b)  # => 3
    print(c)  # => 5  

fn sum_inout(inout x: Int, inout y: Int) -> Int:  # 1
    x += 1
    y += 1
    return x + y
```

This is a potential source of bugs, that's why Mojo forces you to be explicit about it with *inout*

## 3.3.2 owned
An even stronger option is to declared an argument as *owned*. Then the function gets full ownership of the value, so that itâ€™s mutable and but also guaranteed unique. This means the function can modify the value and not worry about affecting variables outside the function.  
For example (see `owned.mojo`):  
```py
from String import String   # 1

fn main():
    mojo()

fn mojo():
    let a: String = "mojo"
    let b = set_fire(a)                      
    print(a)        # => "mojo"
    print(b)        # => "mojoðŸ”¥"

fn set_fire(owned text: String) -> String:   # 2
    text += "ðŸ”¥"
    return text
```

Our variable to be owned is of type `String`. This type and its methods(??) are defined in module String, which is not built-in like `Int`. It has to be imported as in line 1.  
`set_fire` takes ownership of variable a in line 2 as parameter `text`, which it changes and returns.  
From the output, we see that the return value b has the changed value, while the original value of a still exists. Mojo made a copy of a to pass this as the text argument.

## 3.3.3  owned and transferred with ^
If however you want to give the function ownership of the value and do NOT want to make a copy (which can be an expensive operation for some types), then you can add the *transfer* operator `^` when you pass variable a to the function.  
The transfer operator effectively destroys the local variable name - any attempt to call it later causes a compiler error.  

If you change in the example above the call to set_fire() to look like this:

```py
let b = set_fire(a^)   # this doesn't make a copy
print(a)        # 3 => error:
```

we get the error: ??
because the transfer operator effectively destroys the variable a , so when the following print() function tries to use a, that variable isnâ€™t initialized anymore.
If you delete or comment out print(a), then it works fine.

>Note: Currently (Aug 17 2023), Mojo always makes a copy when a function returns a value.

## 3.4 Structs
>Note: At this time (Aug 2023), Mojo doesn't have the concept of "class", equivalent to that in Python; but it is on the roadmap.

You can build high-level abstractions for types (or "objects") in a *struct*. A struct in Mojo is similar to a class in Python: they both support methods, fields, operator overloading, decorators for metaprogramming, and so on. 
However, Mojo structs are completely static - they are bound at compile-time, so they do not allow dynamic dispatch or any runtime changes to the structure.

Here is a basic struct example (see `struct1.mojo`):  
```py
struct IntPair:   
    var first: Int          # 1
    var second: Int         # 2

    fn __init__(inout self, first: Int, second: Int):   # 3
        self.first = first
        self.second = second
    
    fn dump(inout self):
        print(self.first)
        print(self.second)

def pair_test() -> Bool:
    let p = IntPair(1, 2)   # 4 
    dump(p)                 # => 1
                            # => 2
    return True

fn main():
    pair_test()
```

The fields of a struct (here lines 1-2) need to be defined as var when they are not initialized (?? are let fields allowed), and a type is necessary.  
The `fn __init__` function (line 3) is an "initializer" - it behaves like a constructor in other languages. It is called in line 4. All methods like it that start and end with __ are called *dunder* methods.  
`self` refers to the current instance of the struct, it is similar to the `this` keyword used in some other languages.

?? fn dump(inout self):    inout is not needed?

Try out:
Add the following line just after instantiating the struct:
`return p < 4`          
What do you see?
-- gives a compile time error

## 3.5 Python integration
Importing and using a Python package in Mojo is very easy.  
Here's an example of how to import the NumPy package (see `numpy.mojo`):

```py
from PythonInterface import Python           # 1

fn main():
    let np = Python.import_module("numpy")   # 2

    array = np.array([1, 2, 3])              # 3
    print(array)  # => [1  2  3]

    ar = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
    print(ar)
    print(ar.shape)                          # 4
```

# =>
# [[ 0  1  2  3  4]
# [ 5  6  7  8  9]
# [10 11 12 13 14]]
# (3, 5)
```

First you have to import the Python module as in line 1: `from PythonInterface import Python`.  
Then you can use the `Python.import_module()` function with the module name (see line 2). You give it a constant name (here `np`), which can be used later to call module methods.
(The equivalent of this line in Python would be: `import numpy as np`.)
Now you can use numpy as if writing in Python, see lines 3-4.

You can import any other Python module in a similar manner. Keep in mind that you must import the whole Python module.  However, you cannot import individual members (such as a single Python class or function) directly - you must import the whole Python module and then access members through the module name.

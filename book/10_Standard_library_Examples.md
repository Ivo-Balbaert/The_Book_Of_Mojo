# 10 Standard library examples

## 10.1 Assert statements
Both constrained and debug_assert are built-in.

### 10.1.1 constrained
`constrained[cond, error_msg]` asserts that the condition cond is true at compile-time. It is used to place constraints on functions.

In the following example we ensure that the two parameters to `assert_positives` are both > 0:

See `constrained.mojo`:
```mojo
fn add_positives[x: Int, y: Int]() -> UInt8:
    constrained[x > 0, "use a positive number"]()     # 1A
    constrained[y > 0]()     # 1B
    return x + y

fn main():
    let res = add_positives[2, 4]()
    print(res)  # => 6
    # _ = add_positives[-2, 4]()  # 2
```

If the condition fails, you get a **compile-time error**, and optionally the error message is displayed.
Line 2 gives the error:  
```
constrained.mojo:2:23: note:               constraint failed: param assertion failed
    constrained[x > 0]()     # 1A
                      ^
```

Or if you supplied a custom error message:
```
constrained.mojo:2:23: note:               constraint failed: use a positive number
```

### 10.1.2 debug_assert
`debug_assert[cond, err_msg]` checks that the condition is true, but only in debug builds. It is removed from the compilation process in release builds. It works like assert in C++.

See `debug_assert.mojo`:
```mojo
fn test_debug_assert[x: Int](y: Int):
    debug_assert(x == 42, "x is not equal to 42")
    debug_assert(y == 42, "y is not equal to 42")

fn main():
    test_debug_assert[1](2)
```

When you run this as `mojo -D ASSERT_WARNING debug_assert1.mojo`, you get the following output:
```
Assert Warning: x is not equal to 42
Assert Warning: y is not equal to 42
```
>Note: -debug-level full and "debug" build are different things; `mojo --debug-level full debug_assert1.mojo` doesn't give any output.

>Note: debug_assert doesn't work in the Playground because this is not a debug build.

## 10.2 Module testing 
This module implements various testing utilities.  

See `testing1.mojo`:
```mojo
from testing import *


fn main():
    let b1 = 3 < 5
    print(assert_true(b1, "This is false!"))  # => True
    print(assert_false(b1, "This is false!"))
    # => ASSERT ERROR: This is false!
    # => False
    let b2 = 3 > 5
    print(assert_true(b2, "This is false!"))
    # => ASSERT ERROR: This is false!
    # => False
    print(assert_false(b2, "This is false!"))
    # => True

    let n = 41
    let m = 42
    print(assert_equal(n, m))  # => False
    print(assert_not_equal(n, m))  # => True

    let p = SIMD[DType.float16, 4](1.0, 2.1, 3.2, 4.3)
    let q = SIMD[DType.float16, 4](1.0, 2.1, 3.2, 4.3)
    print(assert_equal(p, q))  # => True

    let p2 = SIMD[DType.float16, 4](1.0, 2.1, 3.2, 4.3)
    let q2 = SIMD[DType.float16, 4](1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4)
    print(assert_almost_equal(p2, q2))
    # => ASSERT ERROR: The input value [1.0, 2.099609375, 3.19921875, 4.30078125] is not close to
    # [1.099609375, 2.19921875, 3.30078125, 4.3984375] with a diff of
    # [0.099609375, 0.099609375, 0.1015625, 0.09765625]
    # False
```

`assert_true(Boolean, message)` tests the Boolean expression which is its first argument. If True, nothing happens. If False, ASSERT ERROR: is printed, followed by message.
`assert_false(Boolean, message)` works the other way around.
Both have a Boolean return value.

Likewise, there are `assert_equal(val1, val2)` and `assert_not_equal(val1, val2)`, where val1 and val2 must be both of type Int, String or SIMD[type, size].
`assert_almost_equal(val1, val2)` checks whether both values are approximately equal (tolerance ??)


## 10.3 Module benchmark

From v5, benchmark no longer requires a capturing fn so you can benchmark functions outside the same scope. You can also print a report with: `report.print()`

See `benchmark_newv5`:
```mojo
from benchmark import Unit, benchmark
from time import sleep

fn sleeper():
    sleep(.01)

fn main():
    let report = benchmark.run[sleeper]()
    print(report.mean())   # => 0.010147911948148149
    report.print()
    print("")
    report.print[Unit.ms]()

# ---------------------

```


See first ยง 10.7

The class allows to benchmark a given function (passed as a parameter) and configure various benchmarking parameters, such as number of warmup iterations, maximum number of iterations, minimum and maximum elapsed time.
Import it in your code through: `import benchmark`
We'll benchmark the execution of the Fibonacci function, defined as follows:
(code: see `running_benchmark.mojo`)`

```mojo
import benchmark
from time import sleep


fn fib(n: Int) -> Int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


fn fib_iterative(n: Int) -> Int:
    var count = 0
    var n1 = 0
    var n2 = 1

    while count < n:
        let nth = n1 + n2
        n1 = n2
        n2 = nth
        count += 1
    return n1


fn sleeper():
    print("sleeping 300,000ns")
    sleep(3e-4)


fn test_fib():
    let n = 35
    for i in range(n):
        _ = fib(i)

fn test_fib_iterative():
    let n = 35
    for i in range(n):
        _ = fib_iterative(i)


fn main():
    var report = benchmark.run[test_fib]()
    print(report.mean(), "seconds")
    # => 0.028419847121951218 seconds

    report = benchmark.run[test_fib_iterative]()
    print(report.mean(), "seconds")
    # => 1.3176532113682314e-17 seconds

    print("0 warmup iters, 5 max iters, 0ns min time, 1_000_000_000ns max time")
    report = benchmark.run[sleeper](0, 5, 0, 1_000_000_000)
    print(report.mean(), "seconds")
    # 1.3327284737390688e-17 seconds
    # 0 warmup iters, 5 max iters, 0ns min time, 1_000_000_000ns max time
    # sleeping 300,000ns
    # sleeping 300,000ns
    # sleeping 300,000ns
    # sleeping 300,000ns
    # sleeping 300,000ns
    # sleeping 300,000ns
    # 0.00040065083333333334 seconds```

Pass the test function in as a parameter:  `benchmark().run[test_fib]()`.
This returns the execution time in seconds.

Let us now compare this to the iterative version (fib_iterative):
# =>  1.3176532113682314e-17 seconds

The compiler has nearly optimized away everything that took time in the previous version.

The 3rd example demonstrates the maximum number of iterations (max_iters) here 5

As the 1st parameter, you can also set up the number of warmup iterations (num_warmup).  
As the 3rd parameter, you can also set up the minimum running time (min_time_ns).

Here is another example:
See `calc_mean_matrix.mojo`:
```mojo

alias dtype = DType.float32
alias simd_width = simdwidthof[DType.float32]()

    var res = Tensor[dtype](t.dim(0), 1)
    for i in range(t.dim(0)):
        for j in range(t.dim(1)):
            res[i] += t[i, j]
        res[i] /= t.dim(1)
    return res


fn row_mean_fast[dtype: DType](t: Tensor[dtype]) -> Tensor[dtype]:
    var res = Tensor[dtype](t.dim(0), 1)

    @parameter
    fn parallel_reduce_rows(idx1: Int) -> None:
        @parameter
        fn vectorize_reduce_row[simd_width: Int](idx2: Int) -> None:
            res[idx1] += t.simd_load[simd_width](idx1 * t.dim(1) + idx2).reduce_add()

        vectorize[2 * simd_width, vectorize_reduce_row](t.dim(1))
        res[idx1] /= t.dim(1)

    parallelize[parallel_reduce_rows](t.dim(0), t.dim(0))
    return res


fn main():
    let t = rand[dtype](1000, 1000)
    var result = Tensor[dtype](t.dim(0), 1)

    let report = benchmark.run[bench_mean]()
  #  let report = benchmark.run[row_mean_naive(t)]()
    let report_fast = benchmark.run[bench_mean_fast]()
    report.print()
    report_fast.print()
    print("Speed up:", report.mean() / report_fast.mean())

## 10.4 Type Buffer from module memory.buffer
A buffer (defined in module memory.buffer) doesn't own the underlying memory, it's a view over data that is owned by another object.

See `buffer1.mojo`:
```mojo
from memory.buffer import Buffer
from memory.unsafe import DTypePointer

fn main():
    let p = DTypePointer[DType.uint8].alloc(8)  
    let x = Buffer[8, DType.uint8](p)           # 1
    x.zero()
    print(x.simd_load[8](0))                    # 2
    # => [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    for i in range(len(x)):                     # 3
        x[i] = i
    print(x.simd_load[8](0))                    # 4
    # => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    var y = x
    y.dynamic_size = 4
    for i in range(y.dynamic_size):
        y[i] *= 10 
    print(y.simd_load[4](0)) # => [0, 10, 20, 30]
    print(x.simd_load[8](0))                    # 5
    # => [0, 10, 20, 30, 4, 5, 6, 7]    

    # SIMD:
    let first_half = x.simd_load[4](0) * 2
    let second_half = x.simd_load[4](4) * 10

    x.simd_store(0, first_half)
    x.simd_store(4, second_half)
    print(x.simd_load[8](0))
    # => [0, 20, 40, 60, 40, 50, 60, 70]        # 6
    
    x.simd_nt_store(0, second_half)
    print(x.simd_load[8](0))
    # => [40, 50, 60, 70, 40, 50, 60, 70]       # 7
    x.simd_fill[8](10)
    print(x.simd_load[8](0))
    # => [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    var z = x.stack_allocation()
    print(x.simd_load[8](0))
    # => [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    print(x.bytecount())  # => 8
    x.aligned_simd_store[8, 8](0, 5)
    print(x.aligned_simd_load[8, 8](0))
    # => [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
    z = x.aligned_stack_allocation[8]()

    from sys.intrinsics import PrefetchOptions
    x.prefetch[PrefetchOptions().for_read().high_locality()](0)
```

In line 1, we allocate 8 uint8 and pass that pointer into the buffer. Then we initialize all the values to zero to make sure no garbage data is used (line 2). Loop through the buffer and set each item in line 3-4.
Now copy the buffer x to y, change the dynamic size to 4, and multiply all the values by 10.  
Now print the values from the original buffer x, to show they point to the same data (line 5).  
Utilize SIMD to manipulate 32 bytes of data at the same time (see lines 6- ).
`simd_nt_store` (nt is non-temporal): Skips the cache for memory that isn't going to be accessed soon, so if you have a large amount of data it doesn't fill up the cache and block something else that would benefit from quick access.  
`simd_fill`: Store the value in the argument for chunks of the width provided in the parameter.  
`stack_allocation`: Returns a buffer with the data allocated to the stack.
`aligned_simd_store`: Some registers work better with different alignments e.g. AVX-512 performs better with 64 bit alignment, so you might want padding for a type like a UInt32.
`aligned_simd_load`: see above
`aligned_stack_allocation`: Allocate to the stack with a given alignment for extra padding
`prefetch`: Specifies how soon until the data will be visited again and how the data will be used, to optimize for the cache.

## 10.5 Type NDBuffer from module memory.buffer
This is an N-dimensional Buffer, that can be used both statically, and dynamically at runtime.  
NDBuffer can be parametrized on rank, static dimensions and Dtype. It does not own its underlying pointer.

See `ndbuffer1.mojo`:  (see also ยง 10.9 for Tensor from stdlib, use that!)
```mojo

The struct defined in line 1 allows you to carry around the pointer that owns the data the NDBuffer is pointing to.
In line 2 we create a shape statically and store data, but be careful there's no safety checks on our struct yet. The buffer is used in line 3 to display the number of elements.  
We can also access elements via it's 3D shape (see lines 4-6).
*Run-time bounds checking*
There are no safety checks on our struct yet so we can access data out of bounds, as seen in line 7.  
Let's make our own __get__ method that enforces bounds checking (see line 8). Line 9 shows that it works.  
This bounds checking isn't optimal because it has a runtime cost, we could create a separate function that checks the shape at compile time:

*Compile-time bounds checking*
This is implemented in the get() method from line 10.   
*idx is a variadic list of Int, so you can pass in as many as you like.
get() Creates a closure named check_dim decorated by @parameter so it runs at compile time, it's checking that each item in *idx is less then the same dimension in the static shape. unroll is used to run it at compile-time i amount of times. This is shown in line 11.

## 10.6 Querying the host target info with module sys.info
Mojo can gather a lot of info on your host machine to finetune its behavior if need be.  
Methods for querying the host target info are implemented in module `sys.info`.

See `target_info.mojo`:
```mojo
from sys.info import (
    alignof,
    bitwidthof,
    simdwidthof,
    simdbitwidth,
    simd_byte_width,
    sizeof,
    os_is_linux,
    os_is_macos,
    os_is_windows
)
from sys.info import (
    has_avx,
    has_avx2,
    has_avx512f,
    has_intel_amx,
    has_neon,
    has_sse4,
    is_apple_m1
)

struct Foo:
    var a: UInt8
    var b: UInt32

fn main():
    print(alignof[UInt64]())  # => 8
    print(alignof[Foo]())     # 1 => 4
    print(bitwidthof[Foo]())  # 2 => 64
    print(simdwidthof[DType.uint64]()) # 3 => 4
    print(simdbitwidth())     # 4 => 256
    print(simd_byte_width())  # 5 => 32
    print(sizeof[UInt8]())    # 6 => 1

    @parameter                # 7
    if os_is_linux():
        print("this will be included in the binary")
    # => this will be included in the binary
    else:
        print("this will be eliminated from compilation process")

    print(os_is_macos())     # => False
    print(os_is_windows())   # => False

    print(has_sse4())        # => True
    print(has_avx())         # => True
    print(has_avx2())        # => True
    print(has_avx512f())     # => False
    print(has_intel_amx())   # => False
    print(has_neon())        # => False
    print(is_apple_m1())     # => False
```

To check the alignment of any type, use the alignof function. In the struct Foo (line 1) it returns 4 bytes. This means each instance of Foo will start at a memory address that is a multiple of 4 bytes. There will also be 3 bytes of padding to accommodate the UInt8.  
bitwidthof in line 2 uses bits instead of bytes to show the width of the type in bits. Type Foo will take 24 bits of padding, as each object can only be placed at multiples of 64 in memory.

simdwidthof is used to show how many of the type can fit into the targets SIMD register, e.g. to see how many uint64's can be processed with a single instruction. For our system, the SIMD register can process 4 UInt64 values at once (see line 3). 
simd_bit_width is the total amount of bits that can be processed at the same time on the host systems SIMD register, line 4 shows 256.
simd_byte_width is the total amount of bytes that can be processed at the same time on the host systems SIMD register, , line 5 shows 32.  
The total size in bytes of an AnyType is given by the `sizeof` function. (line 6).

The same module also contains the values os_is_linux, os_is_macos, os_is_windows, which can be used to conditionally compile code based on the operating system (see line 7).

A number of other functions starting with has_ or is_ give info about the processor type/capabilities of the host system. (see line 8 and following).
* has_sse4(): SSE4 is the older SIMD instruction extension for x86 processors (introduced in 2006).
* has_avx(): AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) are instructions for x86 SIMD support. They are commonly used in Intel and AMD chips (from 2011 onwards).
* has_avx2(): AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) are instructions for x86 SIMD support, expanding integer commands to 256 bits (from 2013 onwards).
* has_avx512f(): AVX512 (Advanced Vector Extensions 512) added 512 bit support for x86 SIMD instructions (from 2016 onwards).
* has_intel_amx(): AMX is an extension to x86 with instructions for special units designed for ML workloads such as TMUL which is a matrix multiply on BF16 (from 2023 onwards).
* has_neon(): Neon also known as Advanced SIMD is an ARM extension for specialized instructions.
* is_apple_m1(): The Apple M1 chip contains an ARM CPU that supports Neon 128 bit instructions and GPU accessible through Metal API.

The following example (taken from the standard Mojo distribution) prints the current host system information using APIs from the sys module.

See `deviceinfo.mojo`:
```mojo
from runtime.llcl import num_cores

    else:
        os = "windows"
    let cpu = String(_current_cpu())
    let arch = String(_triple_attr())
    var cpu_features = String(" ")
    if has_sse4():
        cpu_features = cpu_features.join(" sse4")
    if has_avx():
        cpu_features = cpu_features.join(" avx")
    if has_avx2():
        cpu_features = cpu_features.join(" avx2")
    if has_avx512f():
        cpu_features = cpu_features.join(" avx512f")
    if has_vnni():
        cpu_features = cpu_features.join(" avx512_vnni")
    if has_intel_amx():
        cpu_features = cpu_features.join(" intel_amx")
    if has_neon():
        cpu_features = cpu_features.join(" neon")
    if is_apple_m1():
        cpu_features = cpu_features.join(" Apple M1")
    print("System information: ")
    print("    OS          : ", os)
    print("    CPU         : ", cpu)
    print("    Arch        : ", arch)
    print("    Num Cores   : ", num_cores())
    print("    CPU Features:", cpu_features)
```

Output on my current machine (WSL2 in Windows 11 on Intel i9 - 24 cores - 64G):
```
System information: 
    OS          :  linux
    CPU         :  alderlake

## 10.7 The time module

See `timing.mojo`:
```mojo
from time import now, sleep, time_function

fn sleep1ms():
    sleep(0.001)

fn measure():
    fn closure():
        sleep1ms()

    let nanos = time_function[closure]()   # 3
    print("sleeper took", nanos, "nanoseconds to run")
    # => sleeper took 1066729 nanoseconds to run

fn main():
    print(now())    # 1 => 227897314188

    # sleep()
    let tic = now()     # 2
    sleep(0.001)
    let toc = now() - tic
    print("slept for", toc, "nanoseconds")
    # => slept for 1160397 nanoseconds

    measure()   
```

Here is example code where we time the execution of the Fibonacci function (see ยง 19.3):
```mojo
from time import now

var eval_begin = now()
var res = fib(50)
var eval_end = now()
let execution_time_sequential = Float64((eval_end - eval_begin))
print("execution_time sequential in ms:")
print(execution_time_sequential / 1000000)
# =>
# execution_time sequential in ms:
# 14253.018341999999
```
(A comparison showed: Julia 21s, Rust 16s, Mojo 14s)

The now() function (line 1) gets the current number of nanoseconds using the systems monotonic clock, which is generally the time elapsed since the machine was booted. Behavior will vary by platform for states like sleep etc.  
The sleep() function can be used to make a thread sleep for the duration in seconds, here 1 ms (see lines 2 and following).  

time_function() (used in line 3) tells you how long it takes (in nanoseconds) for a function closure to execute: pass in a nested function (also known as a closure that takes no arguments and returns None as a parameter), to time a function for example sleep1ms.

## 10.8 Vectors from the module utils.vector
(?? Table schema with properties ?)

InlinedFixedVector: small-vector optimization
UnsafeFixedVector: fixed-capacity vector without bounds checks
DynamicVector: dynamic resizing vector

### 10.8.1 DynamicVector
(see also ยง 4.3.2, 4.5, 7.9.2)
This Vector type dynamically allocates memory to store elements.
It supports pushing and popping from the back, resizing the underlying storage to accommodate more elements as needed. 

See `dynamicvector1.mojo`:
```mojo
from utils.vector import DynamicVector

fn main():
    var vec = DynamicVector[Int](8)  # 1

    vec.push_back(10)
    vec.push_back(20)
    print(len(vec))     # 2 => 2
    print(vec.size)     # => 2

    print(vec.capacity) # 3 => 8
    print(vec.data[0])  # 4 => 10
   
    print(vec[0])       # 5 => 10
    vec[1] = 42     
    print(vec[1])       # => 42
    print(len(vec))     # => 2
    vec[6] = 10         # 6
    print(len(vec))     # => 2

    let vec2 = vec      # 7
    vec[0] = 99
    print(vec2[0])      # => 99

    let vec3 = vec.deepcopy()  # 8
    vec[1] = 100
    print(vec3[1])      # => 42

    print(len(vec))     # => 2
    print(vec.pop_back()) # 9 => 
    print(len(vec))     # => 1

    vec.reserve(16)     # 10
    print(vec.capacity) # => 16
    print("after reserving: ", vec.size)     # => 1

    vec.resize(10)      # 11
    print("after resizing: ", vec.size)     # => 10

    vec.clear()         # 12
    print(vec[1])       # => 1  ??
    print(vec.size)     # => 0
    print(len(vec))     # => 0
```

You can reserve memory to add elements without the cost of copying everything if it grows too large. For example, we reserve 8 bytes in line 1 to store Int values.  
Adding elements to the back is done with the push_back method, and len (line 2) gives the number of items, which is also given by vec.size. 
(why are there two ways ?? len and size) 
Other useful variables are:
* capacity: the memory reserved for the vector
* the `data` field, which gives access to the underlying storage by indexing. But you can also use indexing by using the vector's name directly as in line 5.

>Notes: 
> when setting new elements with vec[i]=  (as in line 6), len doesn't change. If you need len, only use push_back
> ?? until now (2023 Sep 19) there is no bounds checking

Copying a DynamicVector (line 7) will result in a shallow copy. vec2 will be a pointer to the same location in memory (schema ??). If we modify vec, then vec2 will also be updated.  

Use a deep copy (line 8) to copy all the data to a different location in memory so it's independent from the original. Modifying the original then won't effect the new copy.

The inverse to push_back is the method pop_back, which will access the last element, deallocate it, and reduce the element size by 1 (see line 9).

The `reserve` method lets you change the capacity (line 10). If it's greater than the current capacity then data is reallocated and moved. If it's smaller, nothing happens. 

The `resize` method discards elements if smaller than current size, or adds uninitialized data if larger (line 11) (why still need for reserve, difference, no reallocation ??). 

The `clear` method deallocates all items in the vector (line 12, doesn't seem to work). The size is set to 0.

### 10.8.2 Sorting a DynamicVector
The sort module in package algorithms implements different sorting functions. Here is an example of usage:  

See `sorting1.mojo`:
```mojo
from algorithm.sort import sort

fn main():
    var v = DynamicVector[Int](3)

    v.push_back(20)
    v.push_back(10)
    v.push_back(70)

    sort(v)

    for i in range(v.size):
        print(v[i])
# =>
# 10
# 20
# 70
```

These functions sort the vector in-place.

### 10.8.3 InlinedFixedVector
This type is a vector type with small-vector optimization.
It allocates memory statically for a fixed number of elements, which eliminates the need for dynamic memory allocation for small vectors.
It does not resize or implement bounds checks, it is initialized with both a small-vector size (statically known) number of slots, and when it is deallocated, it frees its memory.
This data structure is useful for applications where the number of required elements is not known at compile time, but once known at runtime, is guaranteed to be equal to or less than a certain capacity.

See `fixedvectors.mojo`:
```mojo
from utils.vector import InlinedFixedVector

fn main():
    var vec = InlinedFixedVector[Int, 4](8)  # 1

    vec.append(10)      # 2
    vec.append(20)
    print(len(vec))     # => 2

    print(vec.capacity)             # => 8
    print(vec.current_size)         # => 2
    print(vec.dynamic_data[0])      # => 1  (??)
    print(vec.static_data[0])       # => 10

    print(vec[0])       # => 10
    vec[1] = 42
    print(vec[1])       # => 42

    print(len(vec))     # => 2
    vec[6] = 10
    vec.clear()
    print(len(vec))     # => 0
    print(vec2.size)        # => 0
```

In line 1, we statically allocate 4 elements, and reserve a capacity of 8 elements. To add elements to the vector, use the append method (line 2).
Access and assign elements using indexes. 

>Notes: 
> when setting new elements with vec[i]= , len doesn't change. If you need len, only use append
> ?? until now (2023 Sep 19) there is no bounds checking

To make a shallow or deep copy, or clear all elements, tee ยง 10.8.1

### 10.8.4 UnsafeFixedVector
This type is a dynamically-allocated vector that does not resize or implement bounds checks (see line 3).
It is initialized with a dynamic (not known at compile time) number of slots.
This data structure is useful for applications where the number of required elements is not known at compile time, but once known at runtime, is guaranteed to be equal to or less than a certain capacity.

You index them as InlineFixedVector (with the same note). Only a shallow copy is possible.

```mojo
    var vec2 = UnsafeFixedVector[Int](8) # 3
    vec2.append(10)
    vec2.append(20)
    print(len(vec))   # => 2

    print(vec2.capacity)    # => 8
    print(vec2.data[0])     # => 10
    print(vec2.size)        # => 2

    vec2.clear()
    print(vec2[1])          # => 20 
```

## 10.9 The Tensor type from module tensor
- From v 0.5.0: 
Tensor has new fromfile() and tofile() methods to save and load as bytes from a file.
The built-in print() function now works on the Tensor type.
TensorShape and TensorSpec now have constructors that take DynamicVector[Int] and StaticIntTuple to initialize shapes.

A tensor is a higher-dimensional matrix, its type Tensor is defined in module tensor (see line 1).  
The tensor type manages its own data (unlike NDBuffer and Buffer which are just views), that is:  the tensor type performs its own memory allocation and freeing. Here is a simple example of using the tensor type to represent an RGB image and convert it to grayscale:
See video: [Introduction to Tensors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OWkXNdkx8E)
Tensorutils: see blogs_videos

See `tensor0.mojo`:
```mojo
from tensor import Tensor

fn main():
    let t = Tensor[DType.int32](2, 2)
    print(t.simd_load[4](0, 1, 2, 3)) # => [0, 1970038374, 26739, 33] 
    t.simd_store[4](0, 1)  # 4 values from start get value 1
    print(t)
    # =>
    # Tensor([[1, 1], [1, 1]], dtype=int32, shape=2x2)
```

See `tensor1.mojo`:
```mojo
from tensor import Tensor, TensorSpec, TensorShape
from utils.index import Index
from random import rand

let height = 256
let width = 256
let channels = 3

fn main():
    # Create the tensor of dimensions height, width, channels
    # and fill with random values.
    let image = rand[DType.float32](height, width, channels) # -> Tensor

    # Declare the grayscale image.
    let spec = TensorSpec(DType.float32, height, width)
    var gray_scale_image = Tensor[DType.float32](spec)

    # Perform the RGB to grayscale transform.
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            let r = image[y,x,0]
            let g = image[y,x,1]
            let b = image[y,x,2]
            gray_scale_image[Index(y,x)] = 0.299 * r + 0.587 * g + 0.114 * b

    print(gray_scale_image.shape().__str__()) # => 256x256
```

Nice example of vectorizing:
See `tensor2.mojo`:
```mojo
from tensor import Tensor
from random import rand
from math import sqrt, round
from algorithm import vectorize
from sys.info import simdwidthof

alias type = DType.float32
alias simd_width: Int = simdwidthof[type]()

fn tensor_math(t: Tensor[type]) -> Tensor[type]:
    var t_new = Tensor[type](t.shape())
    for i in range(t.num_elements()):
        t_new[i] = sqrt(t[i])  # some for round isntead of sqrt
    return t_new

fn tensor_math_vectorized(t: Tensor[type]) -> Tensor[type]:
    var t_new = Tensor[type](t.shape())
    
    @parameter
    fn vecmath[simd_width: Int](idx: Int) -> None:
        t_new.simd_store[simd_width](idx, sqrt(t.simd_load[simd_width](idx)))
    vectorize[simd_width, vecmath](t.num_elements())
    return t_new


fn main():
    let t = rand[type](2,2)
    print(t.shape().__str__()) # 3x3
    print(t.spec().__str__())  # 3x3xfloat32
    # print(t[0]) # => 0.1315377950668335
    # print(t[1]) # => 0.458650141954422
    # print(t[2]) # => 0.21895918250083923
    # print(t.num_elements()) # => 9

    # tensorprint() utility ?
    for i in range(t.num_elements()):
       print(t[i]) 

    print()
    let t1 = tensor_math(t)
    for i in range(t1.num_elements()):
       print(t1[i]) 

    print()
    let t2 = tensor_math_vectorized(t)
    for i in range(t2.num_elements()):
       print(t2[i]) 

    print(simd_width) # => 8
```


## 10.10 Working with command-line arguments
This is done with module arg from the sys package.

See `cmdline_args.mojo`:
```mojo
from sys import argv

fn main():
    print("There are ")
    print(len(argv()))  # => 3
    print("command-line arguments, namely:")
    print(argv()[0])    # => cmdline_args.mojo
    print(argv()[1])    # => 42
    print(argv()[2])    # => abc
```

If this program is executed with the command: `$ mojo cmdline_args.mojo 42 "abc"`;
the output is:
```
There are
3
command-line arguments, namely:
cmdline_args.mojo
42
abc
```

## 10.11 Working with memory

See also:  Buffer ยง 10.4, 10.5
           Pointer ยง 12
See examples memset, memcpy, memset_zero

The `stack_allocation` function lets you allocate data buffer space on the stack, given a data type and number of elements, for example:  
` let rest_p: DTypePointer[DType.uint8] = stack_allocation[simd_width, UInt8, 1]()`


## 10.12 Working with files
This is done through the file module (v 0.4.0).

Suppose we have a my_file.txt with contents: "I like Mojo!"

See `read_file.mojo`
```mojo
fn main() raises:
    var f = open("my_file.txt", "r")
    print(f.read())     # => I like Mojo!
    f.close()   

    with open("my_file.txt", "r") as f:      # 1
        print(f.read()) # => I like Mojo!
```

The with in line 1 closes the file automatically.

## 10.13 The module sys.param_env
Suppose we want to define a Tensor with an element type that we provide at the command-line, like this:  mojo -D FLOAT_32 param_env1.mojo
The module sys.param_env provides a function is_defined, which returns true when the same string was passed at the command-line.

See `param_env1.mojo`:
```mojo
from sys.param_env import is_defined
from tensor import Tensor, TensorSpec

alias float_type: DType = DType.float32 if is_defined["FLOAT32"]() else DType.float64

fn main():
    print("float_type is: ", float_type)  # => float_type is:  float32
    let spec = TensorSpec(float_type, 256, 256)
    let image = Tensor[float_type](spec)
```

In the same way, you can also use name-value pairs, like -D customised=1234. In that case use the functions env_get_int or env_get_string.

Another example simulating a testing environment with mojo -D testing comes https://github.com/rd4com/mojo-learning, see `param_env2.mojo`. It also shows how to print in color on the command-line.

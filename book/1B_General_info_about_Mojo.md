# 1B â€“ General info about Mojo
Mojo is developed inside a company called *Modular*, which was established in Jan 2022.    
The company's goals are based on two pillars:  

1- the *Modular Inference Engine*, the fastest unified AI execution engineDevelop and commercialize   

2- *Mojo*, as the next generation AI software development platform. All the kernels that power the Modular Inference Engine are written in Mojo.

Mojo is designed and developed by **Chris Lattner** (the creator of the Swift programming language and LLVM Compiler Infrastructure - CEO of Modular) and Tim Davis (MLIR Product Manager at Google - Chief Product Officer of Modular), together with their team at Modular.

Mojo was announced in a [Product launch keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Kf2ZZU-dg&t=0s) on May 2 2023.
Its design and implementation started on Sep 27, 2022, when the first piece of Mojo was added (a lexer).

Mojo will be open-sourced when the language is more ready for practical usage. (??License: ) 

Mojo's community, supported by the Modular Mojo team, is also very helpful and welcoming.

## 1B.3 A brief history, status and roadmap 
* 2022 - work on design started
    Sep 7 : first patch published
* 2023 May 2 - Product Keynote Launch
    Chris Lattner considers Mojo to be at v 0.1

Goals / Roadmap:
* 2023 Jun 21 - "We expect that Mojo will be open-sourced. However, Mojo is still young, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until more of its internal architecture is fleshed out. We donâ€™t have an established plan for open-sourcing yet."
* Releasing a local Mojo SDK (closed beta)
* a command-line REPL is coming soon
* 2023 Jun 17 - A rough estimate mentioned by the team is that the language might be very usable for a lot of things in 18 months, so about 2024 Dec

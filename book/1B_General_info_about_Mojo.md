# 1B â€“ General info about Mojo
Mojo is developed by a company called *Modular*, which was established in Jan 2022.    
The company's goals are based on two pillars:  

1- *MAX* =  Modular Accelerated Xecution, the fastest unified AI execution engine which will be commercialized.   
 An integrated, composable suite of products that simplify your AI infrastructure and give you everything you need to deploy low-latency, high-throughput generative and traditional inference pipelines into production. MAX will be available in a free, non-commercial Developer Edition and a paid, commercial Enterprise Edition in early 2024.
2- *Mojo*, as the next generation AI software development platform. All the kernels that power MAX are written in Mojo.

Mojo is designed and developed by **Chris Lattner** (the creator of the Swift programming language and LLVM Compiler Infrastructure - CEO of Modular) and Tim Davis (MLIR Product Manager at Google - Chief Product Officer of Modular), together with their team at Modular.

Mojo was announced in a [Product launch keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Kf2ZZU-dg&t=0s) on May 2 2023.
Its design and implementation started on Sep 27, 2022, when the first piece of Mojo was added (a lexer).

Mojo will be open-sourced when the language is more ready for practical usage. (Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions) 

Mojo's community, supported by the Modular Mojo team, is also very helpful and welcoming.


## 1B.1 Some info about the name and logo.
The name of the language is **Mojo**, meaning "a magical charm" or "magical powers", which are applied to Python. 

Its logo is the [fire emoticon](https://emojipedia.org/fire) (?, werkt niet), the U+1F525 Unicode character. You can find it in the repo as: fire.png, kan emoji niet in file zetten??.

Mojo is also the first language to introduce emojis as file extensions:
Mojoâ€™s source files have the fire emoticon extension like hello.ðŸ”¥, or alternatively *.mojo*, as in *hello.mojo*.  
Mojoâ€™s packages have an emoticon extension like greetings.ðŸ“¦, or alternatively *.mojopkg*, as in *greetings.mojopkg*.  

Mojo users are called *mojicians ðŸª„*.
The universe of all things Mojo is called the *Modverse*.

To search on internet for info on Mojo, use the search terms  "Mojo programming language" or "mojolang".

## 1B.6 Some one-liners
* MojoðŸ”¥: The Language of AI
* Python++
* Mojo was created to integrate Pythonâ€™s usability with Câ€™s performance
* Mojo is as simple as Python and as fast as Rust.
* Mojo: a super-charged Python for AI.
* "It's time to get your Mojo ðŸ”¥ back!"
* Mojo is to Python like TypeScript is to JavaScript.
* If Mojo can defeat Go in terms of parallelism, Rust in terms of safety, Julia in terms of affinity, it will reach unprecedented popularity among developers.
* Faster than C++, more hackable than Nvidiaâ€™s CUDA, and as safe as Rust.
* The best of multiple worlds: the ease of use and clear syntax of Python, with the speed and memory safety of Rust.
* Mojo may become the lingua franca of the programming world.

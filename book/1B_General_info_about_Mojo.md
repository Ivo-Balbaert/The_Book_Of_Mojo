# 1B â€“ General info about Mojo
Mojo is developed inside a company called *Modular*, which was established in Jan 2022.    
The company's goals are based on two pillars:  

1- the *Modular Inference Engine*, the fastest unified AI execution engineDevelop and commercialize   

2- *Mojo*, as the next generation AI software development platform. All the kernels that power the Modular Inference Engine are written in Mojo.

Mojo is designed and developed by **Chris Lattner** (the creator of the Swift programming language and LLVM Compiler Infrastructure - CEO of Modular) and Tim Davis (MLIR Product Manager at Google - Chief Product Officer of Modular), together with their team at Modular.

Mojo was announced in a [Product launch keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Kf2ZZU-dg&t=0s) on May 2 2023.
Its design and implementation started on Sep 27, 2022, when the first piece of Mojo was added (a lexer).

Mojo will be open-sourced when the language is more ready for practical usage. (??License: ) 

Mojo's community, supported by the Modular Mojo team, is also very helpful and welcoming.

## 1B.1 Some info about the name and logo.
The name of the language is **Mojo**, meaning "a magical charm" or "magical powers", which are applied to Python. 

Its logo is the ![fire emoticon](??), the U+1F525 Unicode character.

Mojoâ€™s source files have the fire emoticon extension like hello.ðŸ”¥, or alternatively *.mojo*, as in *hello.mojo*.

Mojo users are called *mojicians ðŸª„*.
The universe of all things Mojo is called the *Modverse*.

## 1B.3 A brief history, status and roadmap 
?? 2019
* 2022 - work on design started
    Sep 7 : first patch published
* 2023 May 2 - Product Keynote Launch Modular engine/Mojo
    Chris Lattner considers Mojo to be at v 0.1
* 2023 Aug 26: Early release Closed Beta Local SDK: Mojo release v 0.2.0
Currently, the Mojo SDK is for Linux only (Ubuntu 16.04 or higher). Native support for Windows is coming.
* 2023 Sep 7: First Mojo release for local download and execution (Linux - v 0.2.1 (64d14e85))
* 2023 Sep 22: Mojo release v 0.3.0

Goals / Roadmap:
* 2023 Jun 21 - "We expect that Mojo will be open-sourced. However, Mojo is still young, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until more of its internal architecture is fleshed out. We donâ€™t have an established plan for open-sourcing yet."
* a command-line REPL is coming soon
* 2023 Jun 17 - A rough estimate mentioned by the team is that the language might be very usable for a lot of things in 18 months, so about 2024 Dec

## 1B.6 Some one-liners
* Python++
* Mojo was created to integrate Pythonâ€™s usability with Câ€™s performance
* Mojo is as simple as Python and as fast as Rust.
* Mojo: a super-charged Python for AI.
* "It's time to get your Mojo ðŸ”¥ back!"
* Mojo is to Python like TypeScript is to JavaScript.
* If mojo can defeat Go in terms of parallelism, Rust in terms of stability, Julia in terms of affinity, it will reach unprecedented popularity among developers.
* Faster than C++, more hackable than Nvidiaâ€™s CUDA, and as safe as Rust.
* The best of multiple worlds: the ease of use and clear syntax of Python, with the speed and memory safety of Rust.

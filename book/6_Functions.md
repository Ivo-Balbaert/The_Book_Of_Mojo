# 6 Functions

A key trick in Mojo is that you can opt in at any time to a faster 'mode' as a developer, by using `fn` instead of `def` to create your function. In this mode, you have to declare exactly what the type of every variable is, and as a result Mojo can create optimized machine code to implement your function.

## 6.1 Difference between fn and def
`def` is defined by necessity to be very dynamic, flexible and generally compatible with Python: arguments are mutable, local variables are implicitly declared on first use, and scoping isnâ€™t enforced. This is great for high level programming and scripting, but is not always great for systems programming.  
To complement this, Mojo provides an `fn` declaration which is like a "strict mode" for def.

`fn`'s have a number of limitations compared to def functions:
* Argument values default to being immutable in the body of the function (like a let), instead of mutable (like a var). This catches accidental mutations, and permits the use of non-copyable types as arguments.
* Argument values require a type specification (except for self in a method), catching accidental omission of type specifications. Similarly, a missing return type specifier is interpreted as returning `None` instead of an unknown return type. Note that both can be explicitly declared to return `object`, which allows one to opt-in to the behavior of a def if desired.
* Implicit declaration of local variables is disabled, so all locals must be declared. This catches name typos with the scoping provided by let and var.
* Both support raising exceptions, but this must be explicitly declared on a fn with the `raises` keyword.

## 6.2  A fn that calls a def needs a try/except
Consider the following example:

See `try_except.mojo`:
```py
def func1(a, b):
    let c = a
    if c != b:
        let d = b
        print(d)  # => 3

fn main():
    func1(2, 3)
```

This gives you an error when compiling: 
```
error: cannot call function that may raise in a context that cannot raise
    func1(2, 3)
    ~~~~~^~~~~~
```

Apparently Mojo thinks that calling a def function can give an exception. Through some notes we get some suggestions to fix this:  
```
note: try surrounding the call in a 'try' block
note: or mark surrounding function as 'raises'
```

So one of the following two forms solves this:
```py
fn main() raises:
    _ = func1(2, 3)
```

or

```py
fn main():
    try:
        _ = func1(2, 3)
    except:  
        print("error")
```

## 6.3 Function arguments and return type
Functions declared as `fn` in Mojo must specify the types of their arguments. If a value is returned, its type must be specified after a `->` symbol and before the body of the function.

Here is a function that returns a Float32 value:
```py
fn func() -> Float32:     
    return 3.14
```

This is illustrated in the `sum` function in the following example (see line 1), which returns an Int value:  
See `sum.mojo`:
```py
fn sum(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int:  # 1
    return x + y

fn main():
    let z = sum(1, 2)
    print(z)    # => 3
```

Change `let z = sum(1, 2)` to just `sum(1, 2)`. Now you don't use the return value of a function, so you get a  `warning: 'Int' value is unused`.
You can print out the return value, or just discard the value with _ = sum(1, 2).

By default, a function cannot modify its arguments values. They are immutable (read-only) references. 

Try it out: make x change in sum.
You are stopped by the following compiler errors:
    x = 42        # => expression must be mutable in assignment
    var x = 42    # => invalid redefinition of 'x'


## 6.4 Argument passing control and memory ownership

### 6.4.1 General rules for def and fn arguments
* All values passed into a `Python def` function use reference semantics. This means the function can modify mutable objects passed into it and those changes are visible outside the function. 
* All values passed into a `Mojo def` function use value semantics by default. Compared to Python, this is an important difference: a Mojo def function receives a copy of all arguments. So it can modify arguments inside the function, but the changes are not visible outside the function.
* All values passed into a `Mojo fn` function are immutable references by default. This means it is not a copy and the function can read the original object, but it cannot modify the object at all: this is called *borrowing*.
The default argument convention for fn functions is *borrowed*. You can make this explicit by prefixing the argument's names with the word `borrowed`:  

```py
fn sum(borrowed x: Int, borrowed y: Int) -> Int:  
    return x + y
```

But what if we want a function to be able to change its arguments?

### 6.4.2 Making arguments changeable with inout 
For a function's arguments to be mutable, you need to declare them as *inout*. This means that changes made to the arguments inside the function are visible outside the function.  
This is illustrated in the following example:  

See `inout.mojo`:
```py
fn main():
    var a = 1
    var b = 2
    c = sum_inout(a, b)
    print(a)  # => 2
    print(b)  # => 3
    print(c)  # => 5  

fn sum_inout(inout x: Int, inout y: Int) -> Int:  # 1
    x += 1
    y += 1
    return x + y
```

This behavior is a potential source of bugs, that's why Mojo forces you to be explicit about it with the keyword *inout*.

### 6.4.2 Making arguments owned
An even stronger option is to declare an argument as *owned*. Then the function gets full ownership of the value, so that itâ€™s mutable, but also guaranteed unique. This means the function can modify the value and not worry about affecting variables outside the function.  
For example:  

See `owned.mojo`:
```py
fn mojo():
    let a: String = "mojo"
    let b = set_fire(a)
    print(a)        # => "mojo"
    print(b)        # => "mojoðŸ”¥"

fn set_fire(owned text: String) -> String:   # 1
    text += "ðŸ”¥"
    return text

fn main():
    mojo()
```

Our variable to be owned is of type `String`. This type and its methods(??) are defined in module string, which is built-in.   
`set_fire` takes ownership of variable a in line 1 as argument `text`, which it changes and returns.  
From the output, we see that the return value b has the changed value, while the original value of a still exists. Mojo made a copy of a to pass this as the text argument.


### 6.4.3 Making arguments owned and transferred with ^
If however you want to give the function ownership of the value and do NOT want to make a copy (which can be an expensive operation for some types), then you can add the *transfer* operator `^` when you pass variable a to the function.  
The transfer operator effectively destroys the local variable name - any attempt to call it later causes a compiler error.  
The ^ operator ends the lifetime of a value binding and transfers the value ownership to something else.

If you change in the example above the call to set_fire() to look like this:

See `owned_transfer.mojo`:
```py
let b = set_fire(a^)   # this doesn't make a copy
print(a)               # => error: use of uninitialized value 'a'
```

we get the error: use of uninitialized value 'a'
because the transfer operator effectively destroys the variable a, so when the following print() function tries to use a, that variable isnâ€™t initialized anymore.
If you delete or comment out print(a), then it works fine.

>Note: Currently (Aug 17 2023), Mojo always makes a copy when a function returns a value.

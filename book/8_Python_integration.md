# 8 Python integration

Mojo allows us to leverage the huge Python ecosystem of libraries and tools.
You can use Python for what it's good at, especially graph plotting and GUIs and for things that do not yet exist or are more difficult to rewrite in Mojo.
That way, a Python project can be gradually migrated to Mojo.

## 8.0 Comparing the same program in Python and Mojo
See `adding.py`:
```mojo
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

z = add(3, 5)
print(z) # => 8
```
versus `adding.mojo`:
```mojo
fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int:
    return x + y

fn main():
    let z = add(3, 5)
    print(z) # => 8
```

Let's do a compute time comparison over 1_000_000 additions (see adding_timing.py and adding_timing.mojo).  
Mojo is 2_422_525 times faster than Python!

## 8.1 Running Python code
To execute a Python expression, you can use the `evaluate` method:  

See `python1.mojo`:
```mojo
from python import Python

fn main() raises:
    var x = Python.evaluate('5 + 10')   # 1 - this is of type `PythonObject`
    print(x)   # => 15

    let py = Python()
    let py_string = py.evaluate("'This string was built' + ' inside of python'")
    print(py_string)  # => This string was built inside of python
 
    let pybt = Python.import_module("builtins")
    _ = pybt.print("this uses the python print keyword") # => this uses the python print keyword

    _ = pybt.print(pybt.type(x))  # => <class 'int'>
    _ = pybt.print(pybt.id(x))    # => 139787831339296
```

If you leave out the keyword `raises`, you get the error:  
```
cannot call function that may raise in a context that cannot raisemojo
python1.mojo(4, 28): try surrounding the call in a 'try' block
python1.mojo(3, 1): or mark surrounding function as 'raises'
```

Apparently, Mojo warns you that `Python.evaluate` could raise an error, that Mojo should catch.

The rhs (right hand side) of line 1 is of type `PythonObject`.  
(The _ = are needed to avoid the warning: 'PythonObject' value is unused)
The above code is equivalent to the following when used in a Jupyter notebook running Mojo (see ยง 2):

```mojo
%%python
x = 5 + 10
print(x)
```

In the Mojo playground, using `%%python` at the top of a cell will run code through Python instead of Mojo.  
Python objects are all allocated on the heap, so x is a heap reference.

All the Python keywords can be accessed by importing `builtins`:
```mojo
let py = Python.import_module("builtins")
py.print("this uses the python print keyword")
```

>Note: The py.print statements work alright, but they generate a warning: "'PythonObject' value is unused", to let this disappear, prefix it with _ =.

Now we can use the `type` built-in from Python to see what the dynamic type of x is:
```mojo
py.print(py.type(x))  # => <class 'int'>
```

The address where the value of x is stored on the heap is given by the Python built-in `id`. This address itself is stored on the stack. (?? schema)

```mojo
py.print(py.id(x))   # =>  139787831339296
```

When Mojo uses a PythonObject, accessing the value actually uses the address in the stack to lookup the data on the heap, even for a simple integer. The heap object contains a reference count, and the runtime will free the object's memory when the count reaches 0. 
A Python object also can change its type dynamically (provided you declare it with var in a fn), which is also stored in the heap object:
```mojo
x = "mojo"            
print(x)              # => mojo
```

All this makes programming easier, but comes with a performance cost!

>Note: You could also just use a def main():, then raises and var x are not needed, and you won't get any warnings!

The equivalent Mojo code is:

See `equivalent.mojo`:
```mojo
fn main():
    let x = 5 + 10
    print(x)    # => 15
```

We've just unlocked our first Mojo optimization! Instead of looking up an object on the heap via an address, x is now just a value on the stack with 64 bits that can be passed through registers.

Here is a simple example of using `matplotlib`:
(If you first need to install this package, use the command: `sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib`)
See `simple_matplotlib.mojo`:
```mojo
from python import Python

fn main() raises:
    let plt = Python.import_module("matplotlib.pyplot")

    let x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    let y = [30, 20, 50, 60]
    _ = plt.plot(x, y)
    _ = plt.show()
```
See image of plot: simple_plot.png

## 8.2 Running Python code in the interpreter mode or in the Mojo mode
The Mojo mode has numerous performance implications:
* There is no overhead associated with compiling to bytecode and running through an interpreter
* All the expensive allocation, garbage collection, and indirection is no longer required
* The compiler can do huge optimizations when it knows what the numeric type is
* The value can be passed straight into registers for mathematical operations
* The data can now be packed into a vector for huge performance gains

So there is a great difference between running Python inside Mojo (through a Python object or %%python), and running Mojo code, although the Mojo code may be exactly the same as the Python code.  

In the 1st case, the Python code is interpreted at compile-time through a CPython interpreter, which communicates with the Mojo compiler.
In the 2nd case, the code is compiled to native code, and then run, which is obviously a lot faster.


## 8.3 Working with Python modules
As already indicated in ยง 3.6.2, here is how you import a Python module, in this case numpy. After importing it, we exercise a few basic functions from numpy, as if writing in Python, see lines 3-4. All variables created (ar, arr, array) are PythonObjects.

See `numpy.mojo`:
```mojo
from python import Python                    # 1

fn main() raises:
    let np = Python.import_module("numpy")   # 2

    let array = np.array([1, 2, 3])          # 3
    print(array)  # => [1  2  3]

    var arr = np.ndarray([5])        
    print(arr)  
    # => [4.67092872e-310 0.00000000e+000 0.00000000e+000 4.67150278e-310 2.37151510e-322]
    arr = "this will work fine"  # Python is loosely typed, so:
    print(arr)                   # => this will work fine

    let ar = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
    print(ar)
    # =>
    # [[ 0  1  2  3  4]
    # [ 5  6  7  8  9]
    # [10 11 12 13 14]]
    print(ar.shape)                          # 4
    # => (3, 5)
```

You can import any other Python module in a similar manner. Keep in mind that you must import the whole Python module.  You cannot import individual members (such as a single Python class or function) directly - you must import the whole Python module and then access members through the variable name you gave the module.

Importing a module could give an error when that module is not locally installed. That's why we must indicate that fn main() could raise an error with: `fn main() raises`.  
A better way to handle this is to use a try/except construct, as in the following program, where we assume the Python pandas module is not locally installed.

See `importing_error.mojo`:
```mojo
from python import Python

fn main():
    try:
        let pd = Python.import_module("pandas")
        print(pd.DataFrame([1,2,3,4,5]))
    except ImportError:
        print('error importing pandas module')
    # => error importing pandas module
```

### 8.3.2 How to do an HTTP-request from Python?
(as an exercise??)

See `http_request_from_py.mojo`:
```py
from python import Python

fn main() raises:
    let requests = Python.import_module("requests")
    let response = requests.get("https://www.standaard.be/")
    print(response.text)

# <head>
#     <meta charset="utf-8">
```

## 8.4 Importing local Python modules
This works just like in the preceding ยง. In the following example, the local Python module `simple_interop.py` is imported through Mojo in line 1. Then in line 2, its `test_interop_func` is called:

See `hello_interop.mojo`:
```mojo
from python import Python
    
def main():
    try:
        Python.add_to_path(".")
        let test_module = Python.import_module("simple_interop")  # 1
        test_module.test_interop_func()                           # 2
    except e:
        print(e.value)
        print("could not find module simple_interop")
```

Because this could potentially raise an exception, the call to Python is enclosed in a `try: except:` statement.  
The Python code imports numpy, printing a "hello" message and then a numpy array:

See ``simple_interop.py`:
```mojo
import importlib
import sys
import subprocess

if not importlib.find_loader("numpy"):
    print("Numpy not found, installing...")
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "numpy"])

import numpy as np
from timeit import timeit

def test_interop_func():
    print("Hello from Python!")   
    # => Hello from Python!
    a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    print("I can even print a numpy array: ", a)  
    # => I can even print a numpy array:  [1 2 3]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(timeit(lambda: test_interop_func(), number=1))
```

If the .py file is somewhere in a different folder, instead of: `Python.add_to_path(".")` do `Python.add_to_path("path/to/module")`

A subfolder `__pycache__` is created which contains the byte-compiled versions (.pyc) of the Python code.  
For another example, see `matmul.mojo` and `pymatmul.py` with output:  
```
$ mojo matmul.mojo

```

## 8.5 Mojo types in Python
Mojo primitive types (bools, integers, floats, strings, lists and tuples (see ยง 9) implicitly convert into Python objects. 

See `mojo_types.mojo`: (works only in a cell in a Jupyter notebook)
```mojo
%%python
def type_printer(my_list, my_tuple, my_int, my_string, my_float):
    print(type(my_list))
    print(type(my_tuple))
    print(type(my_int))
    print(type(my_string))
    print(type(my_float))

type_printer([0, 3], (False, True), 4, "orange", 3.4)
```

**Exercises**
1- Use the Python interpreter to calculate 2 to the power of 8 in a PythonObject and print it
(see `exerc8.1.mojo`)
2- Using the Python math module, return pi to Mojo and print it
(see `exerc8.2.mojo`)
3- Use the input() function from the Python builtins module to get user input, and then display it.
(see `get_input.mojo`)

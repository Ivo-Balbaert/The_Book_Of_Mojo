# The Way to Mojo

A gradual guide to discover and learn the Mojo programming language.  
At the moment, these are mostly notes from all Mojo material (website, GitHub, videos, articles, social media, examples) I am working through.
They will gradually be transformed into a real book, following the progress of Mojo.
